# Algorithms in Python
- This repository contains all algorithms that I have understood and programmed myself during my enrollment to the **[Algorithm Toolbox]** course on Coursera
- I would like to thank the entire team for making such an extensive course and enabling me to implement algorithms myself.
- Each algorithm folder in-turn contains a readme file specifying the task ,contrainsts, input & output.
